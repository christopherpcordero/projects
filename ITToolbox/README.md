# üîê Azure Security Hygiene & Automation Framework

This project is a modular and scalable Azure security automation and monitoring framework designed to help organizations proactively identify misconfigurations, reduce privilege risk, and detect suspicious or non-compliant activity across their Azure tenant.

It uses a combination of:
- PowerShell scripts (for proactive checks)
- Microsoft Graph API (for identity and role data)
- KQL detections in Microsoft Sentinel / Log Analytics (for log-based alerting)
- Optional integrations with Teams, email, or ticketing systems

---

## üìå Goals

- Enforce identity and credential hygiene (e.g., expiring secrets, password rotation)
- Monitor privileged account activity and usage
- Alert on behavioral anomalies (e.g., account lockouts)
- Log resource changes to support audit and insider threat detection
- Provide a low-cost, extensible alternative to commercial CSPM tools

## üß© Modules

### üîπ PowerShell-Based Checks

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Get-AppRegSecretExpirationReport.ps1` | Detects Azure App Registrations with secrets or certificates expiring within 30 days. |
| `Get-UsersPWReport.ps1` | Identifies Entra ID users with passwords set to expire soon, supporting credential lifecycle enforcement. |
| `Get-GlobalAdminsReport.ps1` | Flags Global Admins who haven‚Äôt logged in for 90+ days to reduce privilege creep and stale access. |

### üîπ KQL-Based Detections (Microsoft Sentinel / Log Analytics)

| Detection | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `user-lockout-detection.kql` | Detects user account lockouts (e.g., ResultType 50053) in sign-in logs ‚Äî useful for brute-force and MFA troubleshooting alerts. |
| `resource-creation-audit.kql` | Monitors and logs all Azure resource creation events, capturing who created what, when, and where ‚Äî valuable for auditing and insider threat review. |
